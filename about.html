        <div class="about">Hello this is my desert build made with magicvoxel. MagicVoxel is a modal building program. The build I have made is a desert and involves a train track and tunnel. I decided I wanted to have 2 valleys that cut through the middle of the build. These streams were hard to make because of the shape and curves going up the sides. The trees are only on one as well as the catias. This was because I wanted a desalet look on the one side that having loads of vegetation around the build. <b>SPELLING</b></div><img src="images/build%20finished.png" width="306">
